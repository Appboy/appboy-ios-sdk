 *   ABKDiscardInAppMessage - The in-app message will be discarded and will not be displayed.
 *
 * The following conditions can cause a in-app message to be offered to the delegate defined by the delegate property on
 * [Appboy sharedInstance].inAppMessageController:
 * - A in-app message is received from the Appboy server.
 * - A in-app message is waiting to display when an UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification event occurs.
 * - A in-app message is added by ABKInAppMessageController method addInAppMessage:.
 *
 * You can choose to manually display any in-app messages that are waiting locally to be displayed by calling:
 * [[Appboy sharedInstance].inAppMessageController displayNextInAppMessageWithDelegate:<your delegate>].

 *
 * If the delegate method returns YES, Appboy will not take any more actions on the provided in-app message and it becomes the

 * The default behavior is that the in-app message will be displayed unless the keyboard is currently active on the screen.

 *
 * This delegate method allows host applications to customize the look of an in-app message while
 * maintaining the same user experience and impression/click tracking as the default Appboy in-app
 * message. It allows developers to pass incoming in-app messages to custom view controllers which 
 * they have created.
 *
 * The custom view controller is responsible for handling any responsive UI layout use-cases. e.g. device orientations,
 * or varied message lengths.
 *
 * Even with a custom view, by inheriting from ABKInAppMessageViewController, the in-app message will automatically animate and
 * dismiss according to the parameters of the provided ABKInAppMessage object. See ABKInAppMessage.h for more information.
 *
 * By default, Appboy will add following functions/changes to the custom view controller, and animate
 * the in-app message on and off the screen, based on the class of the given in-app message:
 *   * ABKInAppMessageSlideup:
 *      * stretch/shrink the in-app message view's width to fix the screen's width. If you wish to
 *        have margins between the in-app message and the edge of the screen, those must be incorporated 
 *        into the custom view controller itself.
 *      * add the impression and click tracking for the in-app message
 *      * when user clicks on the in-app message, call the onInAppMessageClicked:, and handle the click
 *        behavior correspond to the in-app message's inAppMessageClickActionType property.
 *      * add a pan gesture to the in-app message so user can swipe it away.
 *   * ABKInAppMessageModal:
 *      * make the in-app message clickable when there is no button(s) on it.
 *      * put the in-app message in the center of the screen, and add a full screen background layer.
 *   * ABKInAppMessageFull:
 *      * make the in-app message clickable when there is no button(s) on it.
 *      * stretch/shrink the in-app message view to fix the whole screen.
 *
 * NOTE: The returned view controller should be a ABKInAppMessageViewController or preferably, a subclass of
 * ABKInAppMessageViewController. The view of the returned view controller should be an instance of ABKInAppMessageView or its
 * subclass.
