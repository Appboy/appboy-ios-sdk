## Components

- `AppboyKit` - Contains the variant of our SDK.
- `Example` - Contains the Stopwatch Sample App which contains integration examples for the iOS SDK.
	- The Stopwatch Sample App uses our [CocoaPods](http://guides.cocoapods.org/) integration (`Appboy-iOS-SDK`), so you must :
	  1. [Install CocoaPods](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
	  2. Run `pod install` in the `Example` directory
	  3. Open the `Stopwatch.xcworkspace` to open the project.

## Version Support

The iOS SDK supports iOS 8.0+. 

Integrating the iOS SDK [requires Xcode 8](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2240). Developers requiring Xcode 7 may integrate Appboy iOS SDK version 2.23 and below. 

Appboy uses [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) 4.3.0 for in-app message icons.  Check out the [cheat sheet](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/) to browse available icons.
