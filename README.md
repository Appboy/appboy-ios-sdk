## Components

- `AppboyKit` - Contains the variant of our SDK.
- `AppboyUI` - Contains the open-source UI code of our SDK. Not all of the UI code of the SDK is open-source.
- `Samples` - Contains sample apps for different Braze features.
- `Example` - Contains the Stopwatch Sample App which contains integration examples for the iOS SDK.
	- The Stopwatch Sample App uses our [CocoaPods](http://guides.cocoapods.org/) integration (`Appboy-iOS-SDK`), so you must :
	  1. [Install CocoaPods](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
	  2. Run `pod install` in the `Example` directory
	  3. Open the `Stopwatch.xcworkspace` to open the project.

## Version Support

The iOS SDK supports iOS 8.0+. 

Integrating the iOS SDK [requires Xcode 9](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#310). Developers requiring Xcode 8 may integrate Braze iOS SDK version 3.0.2 and below. 

Braze uses [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) 4.3.0 for in-app message icons.  Check out the [cheat sheet](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/) to browse available icons.
