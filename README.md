## Components

- `AppboyKit` - Contains the variant of our SDK.
- `AppboyUI` - Contains the open-source UI code of our SDK. Not all of the UI code of the SDK is open-source.
- `Samples` - Contains sample apps for different Braze features.
- `Example` - Contains the Stopwatch Sample App which contains integration examples for the iOS SDK.
	- The Stopwatch Sample App uses our [CocoaPods](http://guides.cocoapods.org/) integration (`Appboy-iOS-SDK`), so you must :
	  1. [Install CocoaPods](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
	  2. Run `pod install` in the `Example` directory
	  3. Open the `Stopwatch.xcworkspace` to open the project.

## Version Support

The iOS SDK supports iOS 9.0+.

Integrating the iOS SDK [requires Xcode 11](https://github.com/Appboy/appboy-ios-sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#3210).
