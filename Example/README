Welcome to Stopwatch, the Appboy sample project!

This project will show you how easy it is to get up and running with Appboy.

Start by taking a look at AppDelegate.m to see how Appboy starts up.  You can copy the sample code
right into your project (make sure you change the API key).

Then, take a look at the storyboards. In the iPhone storyboard, you'll see an example of how to open the
Appboy news feed via a push onto the navigation stack using an ABKFeedViewControllerNavigationContext.  In the iPad
storyboard, there is an example of how to use the ABKFeedViewControllerGenericContext in a split-view controller.

There are also examples of how to create news feed and feedback forms programmatically. The InitialViewController
shows how to open the feed and feedback in popovers.  The InfoViewController has a feedback view controller which
opens in a modal view.

Next, take a look at the SlideupControlsViewController to see how to handle displaying and/or queuing incoming slideups.
The UserAttributesViewController shows how to communicate user info to Appboy.  TestingViewController enables
and disables Appboy, and displays counts of the cards currently in the news feed.

Finally, look around for other examples of how to use the methods in Appboy.h;  almost all of them are covered
in the sample code.

Enjoy, and don't hesitate to contact us if you have questions!  support@appboy.com
