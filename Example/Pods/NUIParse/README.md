NUIParse
========

NUIParse is a fork of [CoreParse](https://github.com/beelsebob/CoreParse), a parsing library for Mac OS X and iOS. For now, please see CoreParse for details.

#### Motivation

CoreParse was our preferred parser for [NUI](https://github.com/tombenner/nui), but the NUI community strongly favors CocoaPods, and CoreParse lacks a maintained podspec and the tagging necessary for a podspec. For relevant discussion, please see [CoreParse #27](https://github.com/beelsebob/CoreParse/pull/27) and [nui #198](https://github.com/tombenner/nui/pull/198). Our solution was to fork CoreParse, maintain it ourselves, and rename it to prevent naming conflicts in the future. The work of CoreParse's author and contributors to bring such an excellent parsing library to the Obj-C community is absolutely appreciated immensely.
