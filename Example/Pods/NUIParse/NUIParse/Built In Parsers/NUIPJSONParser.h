/**
 * The NUIPJSONParser class is a demonstration of NUIParse.
 * 
 * The parser deals with all JSON except for unicode encoded characters.  The reason for not dealing with this corner case is that this parser is simply to demonstrate how to use NUIParse, and
 * the code needed to process unicode characters is non-trivial, and not particularly relevant to the demonstration.
