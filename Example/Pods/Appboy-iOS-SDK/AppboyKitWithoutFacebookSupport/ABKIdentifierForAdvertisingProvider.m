 * The future availability of IDFAs will enable functionality like integrating with other third-party systems,

 * If you continue to record them we will store IDFAs free of charge so you can take advantage of these options
 * immediately when they are released without additional development work.

 * To enable IDFA collection add a PreProcessor Macro to your build settings called ABK_ENABLE_IDFA_COLLECTION=1
